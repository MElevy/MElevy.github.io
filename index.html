              This personal portfolio was hand-coded. 
              Throughout this project, I learned about html, css, and javascript.
              This Project really tested my determination, and my focus.

              In sixth grade, we had a project called genius hour:
              Every week we had about an hour to work on a project of our choice.
              My project was a simple video game akin to Space Invaders (But simpler). 
              This was the result:

              From grades 8-9 I was on my schools soccer team, which in grade 9 made it to the city finals.
              We unfortunately lost from there, but it was a great experience.
              I unfortunately didn't make it into the senior team in grade 10, but I bounced back and
              joined the Van U team. Playing on both these teams was/is a great experience, 
              and the dedication it taught me permeates throught ever aspect of my life.
